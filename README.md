Some game using LiquidFun and SFML

Work in progress

Gameplay
========
* 2D levels with platforms, wasd movement and jumping
* levels contain pipes which are leaking fluid
* the player is tasked to patch the leaks with superglue
* superglue is moderately viscous and sticky
* the superglue can be thrown, dries instantly and is repulsed by any fluid in the pipes
* incorrectly placed superglue can be dissolved by antiglue
* antiglue has low viscosity and does not stick to anything, i.e. redundantly placed antiglue just drips into oblivion
* antiglue and superglue reacts with each other and on contact, both dissolve quickly into a mixture with very low viscosity that evaporates quickly
