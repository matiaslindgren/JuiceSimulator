JuiceSimulator
==============

This simulator allows you to enthusiastically mix 3 different colored juices as you please. The dispensers have 4 different dispensing rates, which are: off, gentle, intense and "do not use even in an emergency". The simulator comes with 3 cups and a sponge, which might come handy in case you were too enthusiastic and everything is covered in juice.
